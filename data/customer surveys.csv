2022,1/1/2022,Alliance Steel,2,3,4,3,3,Our main 2 issues are lead times and communication. We have a customer base that will not be okay with lead times 3+ weeks out and then quoted run dates that are not met. Communication is also sub par. We ask questions that more often than not are not answered same day and sometimes just go unanswered. If this continues we will be forced to make alternative arrangements for a portion of our tonnage.

2022,1/1/2022,Super Stud South,4,4,4,3,3,"Overall, pretty easy to work with. But a more prompt response time to questions and requests, even if it's not the answer we want to hear, would be appreciated. Some emails and calls go completely unanswered."
2022,1/1/2022,Heidtman Steel Products,4,4,4,5,4,Everyone @ MSP is awesome. Orders done in a timely manner.

2022,1/1/2022,Phoenix Metals,5,5,5,5,5,"Only issue right now is that lead times are extended to 10-12 business days, when they used to be 4-5. I was told they would be improving but they haven't really changed and I can't get an answer on when they will hopefully be better, which makes it very tough to know how much inventory to have cut. We run on very lean inventories, so short lead times are crucial to how we operate."
2022,1/1/2022,Steel Dynamics,3,4,3,5,4,Single point material is late most of the time. Once material is on the floor it takes 3+ weeks to have material processed.

2022,1/1/2022,Allen Gate and Panels,4,5,2,4,4,Sometimes it very hard to get anyone on the phone. There are somethings that are a lots easier and faster if you can talk to someone instead of email. They all seem to to be very busy but sometimes it take days to get a current inventory or production updates. The processing is always done properly and the shipping department is pretty easy to work with. The pricing is a lot higher than other processors that I use.
